Well let us talk about sports shall we. I do like sports sometimes.
I used to be a big cowboys fan and I would organize a trip to the cowboys game with some of my friends
and coworkers. It became a tradition and it was a good time to tailgate and have fun once a year, win or lose.
Now I watch sports from time to time but only on social occations.
